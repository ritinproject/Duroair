FABTECH is back! We’re more than pleased at Duroair to, once again, be a part of [FABTECH 2022](https://www.fabtechexpo.com/attend) — North America's largest metal fabrication event. The event is anticipated to attract thousands of visitors and well over 1,000 vendors to **Atlanta, Georgia from November 8-10, 2022**, with new, advanced manufacturing solutions for increasing productivity and efficiency.

**Duroair will be located at booth #B5019**, where we will be showcasing our latest [modular air filtration innovations for metal fabricators](https://www.duroair.com/industries/metal-fabrication) that can significantly enhance safety, meet compliance, and maximize productivity during the coating, painting, grinding, and sanding processes.

By combining flexible, non-vented air filtration systems with Duroair's retractable enclosures, metal fabricators can create a cost-effective clean air solution for painting and coating operations. Instead of a costly, permanent, paint booth construction, these modular clean air solutions save money by eliminating air make-up expenses and support lean manufacturing processes.

**Visit our FABTECH Booth #B5019 and learn how our solutions can:**

* Create fully compliant, modular clean rooms for contamination control.
* Improve dry times, control overspray, and mitigate worker exposure during painting and coating processes.
* Reduce capital expense and operating costs from installation and air make-up.
* Bring clean air environments to large workpieces to reduce material handling bottlenecks and optimize floor space utilization.
* Gain full use of overhead cranes for loading and unloading large workpieces from contained workspaces. 

To see how a Duroair solution can have a positive impact on both compliance and your bottom line, [schedule a free consultation](https://www.duroair.com/contact-us) with one of our clean air experts at FABTECH 2022.
