  ### Modular Industrial Air Filtration Solutions for Military and Defense
  Manufacturing


  Duroair modular industrial air filtration systems for military and defense brings clean air to each rapid-moving manufacturing operation.  With a retractable [DuroRoom™](/products/duroroom) and vented or non-vented air filtration, each system can be engineered to accommodate large components for jets, MRAPs, or submarines, creating a cost-effective alternative to conventional systems.


  Military and defense OEM clean air solutions include:


  * **Repair and refinishing booths** with our [DuroCap™](/products/durocap), with [Taper Daft Airflow](/products/taper-draft-airflow-technology) technology that captures 99.4% of toxic dust from sanding and grinding tasks, often generated while working on paint from MRAPs

  * **Climate-controlled painting and coating rooms** in portable, retractable enclosures with [DuroPure™](/products/duropure) non-vented air filtration that easily move with grinding, painting, or sanding assignments and collect 100 percent of hexavalent chromium contaminants 

  * **Prototyping clean air booths** with retractable enclosures for overhead crane access and non-vented air filtration for self-contained security

  * **Special anterooms with HEPA filtration** designed to contain, capture, and collect particulates as operators move from inside a retractable enclosure to the general shop environment

  * **Down draft worktables** engineered to capture and collect contaminates generated while prepping, sanding, grinding, or cutting

    From U.S. military bases to military operations around the world,
    operational readiness depends on flexible, reliable maintenance, repair, and
    operations (MRO). But MRO tasks like sanding and painting can release
    dangerous, airborne hexavalent chromium and VOCs. How do you isolate and
    contain these threats while ensuring MRO flexibility?


    Fortunately, Duroair has created a new formula for clean-air flexibility by combining portable industrial air filtration technology with retractable enclosures. Our retractable enclosures isolate, contain, and protect processes as engineered filtration mitigates harmful contaminates for a compliant, tested, and verified clean air solution.


    Plus, Duroair's flexible, modular, and retractable solutions are more affordable than designated paint rooms and work spaces and move with military maintenance workflows. They're a cost-effective way to facility material handling challenges associated with coating operations, surface prep, mechanical assembly, isolation rooms, NDT, dust collection, and ISO clean rooms.

      * Simplify material handling with access to overhead cranes

      * Repair components to complete aircraft or ground equipment

      * Contain decontamination processes and NDT

      * Maximize floor space. It retracts to 20% of its extended length

      * Customize with retractable sizes up to 50'H x 65'W in any length

      * Customize as a fixed system up to 50'H x 150'W in any length

      * Simplify workflows and save valuable hours

      * Multiply productivity in shared larger spaces by creating contained work cells

      * Create Plug-and-Play transition rooms (i.e., anterooms or gowning rooms)

      * Recirculating, non-vented, six-stage filtration.

      * Robust CFM to meet airflow requirements @ 100 FPM, less than 25% LEL is maintained.

      * Three (3) stages of particulate collection. It captures paint particulate including hexavalent chromium and particulate isocyanates. Final filter exceeds NESHAP 319.

      * Three (3) stage gas filtration; captures isocyanates in gas stage and destroys VOCs.

      * Two (2) stages of activated carbon filtration. Over 70lbs of carbon for every 2000 CFM.

      * UV light with PCO (photocatalytic oxidation). Converts organic pollutants into carbon dioxide and water.

      * No ducting or makeup air is required.

      * Plug and Play and can be generator-ready.

      * DCPH-A tested, confirmed, and verified.

      * Each system is monitored.
